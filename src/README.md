ABODE DEVEOPER DOCUMENTATION
----------------------------

This document has been put together to aid anyone who needs (or wants) to develop ABODE,
however it is far from a full system documentation! ABODE has been primarily developed
by two people previously:

	Steven Gray (Cobalt Software) - original designer and author of most of the code
	<insert Steve's e-mail>
	
	James Nugent (Gentec Services) - general code cleanup, new code generator (to
	jen20@bath.ac.uk					accomodate grammar changes  in Jan's new POSH engine),
									new parser for this file format, addition of documentation,
									addition of element disabling.
	
The project was overseen by Joanna Bryson (jjb@cs.bath.ac.uk).

The project has been checked into Subversion as an Eclipse project (note that it was
originally developed using Netbeans, and handled through CVS, and some of the comments
in the header files of code which hasn't changed still reflects their original path as
given by Steve).

The project is set to build into a path called $project/bin, however it will not build
as a JAR file by default; these need to be packaged as appropriate. This will eventually
be built into the Eclipse project (when I have time/need to make a release). In the meantime
you can run ABODE directly from Eclipse.

See the MacOS page on Joanna Bryson's website (http://cs.bath.ac.uk/~jjb/here/macOSX.html) for
relatively detailed instructions on installing Subversion on MacOS, and installing a plugin
to deal with Subversion through Eclipse on any platform (although, I would assume that since
this file is in the repository and you are reading this, that you've already got it checked
out, so this entire paragraph may be fairly pointless...).

Note that some of the packages have moved around since the original version, specifically
all the libraries are now in package lib rather than abode.lib, and Main is in a package
called abode. A fun job for someone with copious amounts of spare time is to work out which
images are used, and remove the ones that aren't.
