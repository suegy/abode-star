####ABODEstar
is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Behavior Oriented Design (BOD).

It is now still in beta mode (despite it's numbering scheme) and allows for the creation of POSH plans. The plans are able to be used in either https://github.com/suegy/posh-sharp or http://sourceforge.net/projects/jyposh/ .

For further information on *ABODE* or *BOD* consult the project website:
http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~jjb/web/BOD/abode.html

----

We currently provide a couple of showcases of what has been done using ABODEstar and POSH.

####Starcraft AI Show Case
A first show case of the ABODE usage is the StarCraft AI Demo by Simon https://github.com/suegy/posh-sharp/wiki/StarCraftAIShowcase

Use it at your own risk!

####Old Version now deprecated

Due to the transition from sourceforge and the new features the previous version of https://sourceforge.net/projects/abode/ is deprecated.

The repository on sourceforge is kept to allow for tracing all changes and version.
